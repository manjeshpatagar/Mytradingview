          Next day watchlist is updated daily and includes an indicative level above or below which the stock may trade.
          The screenshot of the best stock for intraday tomorrow is shown below, generated every day on the Intradayscreener app.

          The algorithm filters stocks based on breakout levels (weekly, monthly, yearly) and volume surges.

          Stocks reacting to earnings (quarterly results) are monitored. Breakouts after positive results can be good short-term opportunities.
